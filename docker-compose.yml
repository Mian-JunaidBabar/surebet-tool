    # The 'npm run dev' command keeps this service running,

  # The Backend API Service (FastAPI)

      # The named volume where the SQLite database will be stored safely
      - sqlite_data:/app/data
    # Removed 'depends_on' to decouple services. The backend can run
    # even if the scraper is restarting.

      # Syncs your local code into the container

    # THIS IS THE FIX: This command is the standard, reliable way to
    # keep a container running indefinitely so we can 'exec' into it.
    command: ["tail", "-f", "/dev/null"]

# Define the named volume for the database so data persists across restarts
